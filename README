Wombat Asset Management System

Built using microframework called flask in python. Utilizes SQLite3 and SQLAlchemy. Currently under construction


Creating Database:
$python
>>> import wombat
>>> wombat.init_db()


*************UPDATE*******************

Use a simple one file database setup

simply do:
python setup.py

*************NOTE*********************

The application will not work out of the box because the database doesn't consist of the tables being used in the code
they have been changed. Wombat is being ported to work on the updated Database
