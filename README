Wombat Asset Management System

Built using microframework called flask in python. Utilizes SQLite3 and SQLAlchemy. Currently under construction


Creating Database:
$python
>>> import wombat
>>> wombat.init_db()


*************UPDATE*******************

Use a simple one file database setup

simply do:
python setup.py



*************3DTests*******************
simply do this after copying the Ogre3D folder into your working directory:

./bootstrap
./configure
make

after having done so you'll find the TutorialApplication.cpp has code and all you need to do after every time you 
edit your code is:
./build-execute.sh

It will automatically compile
build and copy the OgreApp binary to the dist/bin so that it can have resource.cfg ready and execute it.



*************NOTE*********************

The application will not work out of the box because the database doesn't consist of the tables being used in the code
they have been changed. Wombat is being ported to work on the updated Database
